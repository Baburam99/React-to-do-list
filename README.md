<h1>To-do list</h1>
<p>this is a to-do list made in React.js using useState() hook. This is a demonstration or you can say a practise file of me using useState()hook in react.</p>
<li> When you type your task in input box and click it it will submit as a list or task. For now I don't have any idea how to make it editabel but in future I will definitely work on this to improve </li>
